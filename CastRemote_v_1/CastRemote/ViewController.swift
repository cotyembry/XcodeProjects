    TODO: fix it if more than one application is online then goes offline (this messes with the boolean variable)

    TODO: see why no media is playing to skip to comes up if one of the text fields still has focus

    TODO: make two edit text boxes with an arrow to jump between the two to specify minutes and seconds

    TODO: make the interface not jump around when the labels get text assigned to them

    TODO: take the view out of the stack view so the interface will be compatable below ios 8

    TODO: make a skip button that will open up the youtube application by going to url youtube:// [this is the only workaround I can think of at this time]

    TODO: figure out why I'm having to use grand central dispatch to get the streamDuration bc if I don't I'll get back an optional value

    TODO: if the app is a youtube video it will give back INF for the stream duration while it is loading the video; make a while loop to check back after a little bit to update the stream duration after the video has loaded

    TODO: when the streamDuration gets set, start a background thread which will later call the main thread to update the progressView bar


    TODO: fix the application background when the app is rotated sideways

    TODO: Figure out how to get the streamDuration right after the application successfully joins to the media

    TODO: make sure that I clear the [Actions] array before adding the devices so that it will correctly reflect when a device goes offline a user can't select the device to try to connect to it


    TODO: make this able to run in the safari app by clicking the share/action button

    A cool thought: what if while the app is running/media is running just from the lockscreen the user can pause, play, fast forward, and rewind the media (much like a podcast does)

    when the device goes offline do stuff
    BUT WHEN THE DEVICE COMES BACK ONLINE....or at least starts a new media session....rejoin the application to make a streamline connection where it works with the new media

    make it where if launching the app before the device is "busy" it will rescan and get the most up to date device status

    TODO: make sure when selecting the disconnect button, that nil wasn't found - or any of the buttons for that matter
    TODO: figure out a way to device.stopScan() so it doesn't use a bunch of battery consumption

    //I'd like to get rid of the while statements that are printing... but I guess it flushes the buffer or something crazy to help to hang on not connecting to the device... not sure

    TODO: find out what services have ads that could come up so I can add the case to the liveStreamOrAd() method case
